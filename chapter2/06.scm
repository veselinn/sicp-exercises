; Exercise 2.6: 
; In case representing pairs as procedures wasn’t mind-
; boggling enough, consider that, in a language that can manipu-
; late procedures, we can get by without numbers (at least insofar as
; nonnegative integers are concerned) by implementing 0 and the
; operation of adding 1 as
; 
;   (define zero (lambda (f) (lambda (x) x)))
;   (define (add-1 n)
;     (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((n f) x)))))
; 
; This representation is known as Church numerals, after its inven-
; tor, Alonzo Church, the logician who invented the λ-calculus.
; Define one and two directly (not in terms of zero and add-1). (Hint:
; Use substitution to evaluate (add-1 zero)). Give a direct defini-
; tion of the addition procedure + (not in terms of repeated applica-
; tion of add-1).

(define zero (lambda (f) (lambda (x) x)))
(define (add-1 n)
  (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((n f) x)))))

(define one (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f x))))
(define two (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f (f x)))))

(define (add f1 f2)
  (lambda (f) (lambda (x) ((f2 f) ((f1 f) x)))))
