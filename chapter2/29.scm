; Exercise 2.29: 
; A binary mobile consists of two branches, a left
; branch and a right branch. Each branch is a rod of a certain
; length, from which hangs either a weight or another binary
; mobile. We can represent a binary mobile using compound data
; by constructing it from two branches (for example, using list):
; 
;   (define (make-mobile left right)
;     (list left right))
; 
; A branch is constructed from a length (which must be a number)
; together with a structure, which may be either a number (repre-
; senting a simple weight) or another mobile:
; 
;   (define (make-branch length structure)
;     (list length structure))
; 
; a. Write the corresponding selectors left-branch and right-
; branch, which return the branches of a mobile, and branch-
; length and branch-structure, which return the components
; of a branch.
; b. Using your selectors, define a procedure total-weight that re-
; turns the total weight of a mobile.
; c. A mobile is said to be balanced if the torque applied by its top-
; left branch is equal to that applied by its top-right branch (that
; is, if the length of the left rod multiplied by the weight hanging
; from that rod is equal to the corresponding product for the right
; side) and if each of the submobiles hanging off its branches is
; balanced. Design a predicate that tests whether a binary mobile
; is balanced.
; d. Suppose we change the representation of mobiles so that the
; constructors are
; 
;   (define (make-mobile left right)
;     (cons left right))
;   (define (make-branch length structure)
;     (cons length structure))
; 
; How much do you need to change your programs to convert to
; the new representation?
