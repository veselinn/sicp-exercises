; Exercise 1.22: 
; Most Lisp implementations include a primitive
; called runtime that returns an integer that specifies the amount
; of time the system has been running (measured, for example,
; in microseconds). The following timed-prime-test procedure,
; when called with an integer n , prints n and checks to see if n is
; prime. If n is prime, the procedure prints three asterisks followed
; by the amount of time used in performing the test.
;
;   (define (timed-prime-test n)
;     (newline)
;     (display n)
;     (start-prime-test n (runtime)))
;
;   (define (start-prime-test n start-time)
;     (if (prime? n)
;         (report-prime (- (runtime) start-time))))
;
;   (define (report-prime elapsed-time)
;     (display " *** ")
;     (display elapsed-time))
;
; Using this procedure, write a procedure search-for-primes that
; checks the primality of consecutive odd integers in a specified
; range. Use your procedure to find the three smallest primes larger
; than 1000; larger than 10,000; larger than 100,000; larger than
; 1,000,000. Note the time needed to test each prime. Since the
; testing algorithm has order of growth of Θ( (sqrt n) ), you should expect
; that testing for primes around 10,000 should take about (sqrt 10) times
; as long as testing for primes around 1000. Do your timing data
; bear this out? How well do the data for 100,000 and 1,000,000
; support the Θ( (sqrt n) ) prediction? Is your result compatible with the
; notion that programs on your machine run in time proportional
; to the number of steps required for the computation?
