; Exercise 1.8: 
; Newtonâ€™s method for cube roots is based on the fact
; that if y is an approximation to the cube root of x , then a better
; approximation is given by the value
;
; ((x / (y * y)) + 2 * y) / 3
;
; Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous
; to the square-root procedure.
